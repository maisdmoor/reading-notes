## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

## Calling the function:If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task

## Return value:When you write a function and  you expect it to provide you  with an answer

## Parameters :Some functions need to be provided with information in  order to achieve a given task. For example, a function to calculate the area of a box would need to know its width and height

## You can have anonymous functions. They do not have a name, so they cannot be called Instead, they are executed as soon as the interpreter comes across them
