## Color 

## You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes : These are six-digit codes thatrepresent the amount of red,green and blue in a color,preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color namesThere are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

## Background Color background-color
## CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
## You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify  foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, color names

## RGB Values :Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255 
## Hex Codes : Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code
## Color Names :Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number

## Hue : Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue
## Saturation : Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray
## Brightness : Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark
